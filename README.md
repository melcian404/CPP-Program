# CPP-Program
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Corner Grocer project is an app that is designed by Chada Tech to help Corner Grocer determine an effective layout for their store based on the frequency of items being purchased. The program covers an easy-to-use input menu, an item tally, and a histogram with item quantity. This essentially provides Corner Grocer with adequate documentation tools and an easy-to-read visual output to help them make decisions involving their future business plans.
# What did you do particularly well?
In this program, the switch statements are a clear-cut way to execute menu options. The prompt menu is neatly displayed as well, with easy-to-understand instructions for the user. 
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
As happy as I am with the switch statements, I think they could be improved to integrate error checking, as I would love to be able to reduce the number of lines in the code for program readability.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging aspect of this code was getting it to read input from a text file. It took some trial and error to understand that openFile() in the public class section needed to be a void type in order to read from the file. The solution came about from reading through the textbook. Naming the file to be read was a challenge. I had it named as CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt. When plugging this name into the code, it would have been required to name it CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt.txt, with the extra ‘txt’ at the end. The solution was renaming the original folder.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The switch statements are an excellent example of code that could be transferrable to many projects. Anything that would have a set number of prompts in a menu would benefit from a switch statement. This could be applied to a number of menu styled shopping orders.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable thanks to the usage of inline comments and clear explanatory naming choices. Other users will be able to mostly understand what each portion of the code is doing, and which variables are being used for which functions. This code can easily be added to or altered.
